The functionality of this App grows daily with contributors working Locally and Globally to improve it: Current Functionality includes:

Tracking all active Epidemics Globally (Not just COVID19) [Only COVID19 has implemented in current version 1]
Keeping people updated through local and International trusted News Platforms [Hotlines, Test centers... etc.].
Keeping people updated with information from the recognized National Disease Control of their country [Only Nigeria has implemented in current version 1]
Provide a platform for Donations and Volunteering towards helping those suffering from a pandemic outbreak (those sick and those infected)

IMPORTANT:
80% of current App functionality is focused on Nigeria (as most contributors are from there), more contributors (content creators, researchers, sponsors... etc), Collaborators and Developers are needed from all Global locations so they can help in build the capacity and reach of the App to fit into their specific location and provide direct help to their region.
